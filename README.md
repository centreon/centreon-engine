# Centreon Engine

Centreon Engine is a fast and powerful open-source monitoring scheduler.
It is a low-level component of the
[Centreon software suite](https://www.centreon.com).

Centreon Engine is released under the General Public License version 2
and is endorsed by the [Centreon company](https://www.centreon.com).

This project was started as a fork of Nagios, the well known open-source
monitoring application. While keeping its configuration file format and
its stability we improved it in several ways:

- Reduced startup time
- Faster standard check execution engine
- New light check execution system (connectors)
- On-the-fly configuration reload
- Less obscure configuration options
- Frequent bugfix releases

Just give it a try!

## Documentation

*Coming soon on https://docs.centreon.com*

## Installing from binaries

> Centreon Engine is a low-level component of the Centreon
> software suite. If this is your first installation you would probably
> want to [install it entirely](https://docs.centreon.com/current/en/installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-sources.html).

Centreon ([the company behind the Centreon software suite](http://www.centreon.com))
provides binary packages for RedHat / CentOS. They are available either
as part of the [Centreon Platform](https://www.centreon.com/en/platform/)
or as individual packages on [our RPM repository](https://docs.centreon.com/current/en/installation/installation-of-a-poller/using-packages.html).

Once the repository installed a simple command will be needed to install
Centreon Engine.

```shell
yum install centreon-engine
```

## Fetching sources

Beware that the repository hosts in-developement sources and that it
might not work at all.

Stable releases are available as gziped tarballs on [Centreon's
download site](https://download.centreon.com).

## Compilation (quickstart)

This paragraph is only a quickstart guide for the compilation of
Centreon Engine.

Centreon Clib should be installed before installing Centreon Engine.
If you do not have Centreon Clib please refer to the
[centreon-clib](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-clib) project.

### CentOS / Debian / Raspbian

Compilation of these distributions is pretty straightforward.

You'll need to download the project and launch the *cmake.sh* script
to prepare the compilation environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/centreon/centreon-engine
cd centreon-engine
./cmake.sh
```

Now launch the compilation using the *make* command and then install the
software by running *make install* as priviledged user:

```shell
cd build
make
make install
```

### Other distributions

If you are on another distribution, then follow the steps below.

Check if you have these packages installed (Note that packages names
come from CentOS distributions, so if some packages names don't match
on your distribution try to find their equivalent names): git, make,
cmake, gcc-c++, python3.

For the projet compilation you need to have conan installed. Try to use
the package manager given by your OS to install conan. ('apt' for
Debian, 'rpm' for Red Hat, 'pacman' for Arch Linux, ...). It is prefered
to install gcc before conan.

Example:

```shell
apt install conan
```

If it does not work, conan can be installed with pip3:

```shell
pip3 install conan
```

> All the dependencies pulled by conan are located in conanfile.txt. If
> you want to use a dependency from your package manager instead of conan,
> you need to remove it from conanfile.txt.

Then you have to add a remote conan repository, for that enter the command:

```shell
conan remote add centreon https://api.bintray.com/conan/centreon/centreon
```

Now, the list command should list two repositories:

```shell
conan remote list
conan-center: https://conan.bintray.com [Verify SSL: True]
centreon: https://api.bintray.com/conan/centreon/centreon [Verify SSL: True]
```

You can now prepare the compilation environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/centreon/centreon-engine
mkdir -p centreon-engine/build
cd centreon-engine/build
conan install --remote centreon --build missing ..
cmake -DWITH_PREFIX=/usr -DWITH_PREFIX_BIN=/usr/sbin -DWITH_USER=centreon-engine -DWITH_GROUP=centreon-engine -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_RW_DIR=/var/lib/centreon-engine/rw -DWITH_PREFIX_CONF=/etc/centreon-engine -DWITH_VAR_DIR=/var/log/centreon-engine -DWITH_PREFIX_LIB=/usr/lib64/centreon-engine ..
```

This will look for required dependencies and print a summary of the
compilation parameters if everything went fine.

Now launch the compilation using the *make* command and then install the
software by running *make install* as priviledged user:

```shell
make
make install
```

Verify the `/etc/centreon-engine` directory.

Usually, its content is filled by the Centreon web interface, owned by the
apache user.

A command like the following may be necessary:

```shell
chown -R apache:apache /etc/centreon-engine/*
```

You're done!

## Bug reports / Feature requests

The best way to report a bug or to request a feature is to open an issue
in GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-engine/issues/).

Please note that Centreon Engine follows the
[same workflow as Centreon](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/issues/new/choose)
to process issues.

For a quick resolution of a bug your message should contain:

- The problem description
- Precise steps on how to reproduce the issue (if you're using Centreon
  web UI tell us where you click)
- The expected behavior
- The Centreon product**s** version**s**
- The operating system you're using (name and version)
- If possible configuration, log and debug files

## Contributing

Contributions are much welcome! If possible provide them as
pull-requests on GitHub. If not, patches will do but describe against
which version/commit they apply.
