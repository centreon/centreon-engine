/**
 *  @page objectdefinitions Object Definitions
 *  @section objectdefinitionsintroduction Introduction
 *
 *  One of the features of Centreon Engine' object configuration
 *  format is that you can create object definitions that inherit
 *  properties from other object definitions. An explanation of how
 *  object inheritence works can be found @link objectinheritance.html
 *  here @endlink. I strongly suggest that you familiarize yourself
 *  with object inheritence once you read over the documentation
 *  presented below, as it will make the job of creating and
 *  maintaining object definitions much easier than it otherwise would
 *  be. Also, read up on the @link timesavingtricksforobjectdefinitions object tricks
 *  @endlink that offer shortcuts for otherwise tedious configuration
 *  tasks.
 *
 *  @note When creating and/or editing configuration files, keep the
 *  following in mind:
 *  - Lines that start with a '#' character are taken to be comments
 *  and are not processed
 *  - Directive names are case-sensitive
 *  - Characters that appear after a semicolon (;) in configuration
 *  lines are treated as comments and are not processed
 *
 *  @section objectdefinitionsretentionnotes Retention Notes
 *
 *  It is important to point out that several directives in host,
 *  service, and contact definitions may not be picked up by Centreon
 *  Engine when you change them in your configuration files. Object
 *  directives that can exhibit this behavior are marked with an
 *  asterisk (@ref objectdefinitionsretentionnotes "*"). The reason for this
 *  behavior is due to the fact that Centreon Engine chooses to honor
 *  values stored in the @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesstateretentionfile
 *  "state retention file" over values found in the config files, assuming you
 *  have @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesstateretentionoption "state retention"
 *  enabled on a program-wide basis and the value of the directive is
 *  changed during runtime with an
 *  @ref mainconfigurationfileoptionsconfigurationfilevariablesexternalcommandcheckoption
 *  "external command".
 *  One way to get around this problem is to disable the retention of
 *  non-status information using the retain_nonstatus_information
 *  directive in the host, service, and contact definitions. Disabling
 *  this directive will cause Centreon Engine to take the initial
 *  values for these directives from your config files, rather than
 *  from the state retention file when it (re)starts.
 *
 *  @section objectdefinitionssampleconfigurationfiles Sample Configuration Files

 *  @note Sample object configuration files are installed in the
 *  /usr/local/centengine/etc/ directory when you follow the

 *  	  this particular host. Hosts can have multiple services (which are
 *  	  monitored) associated with them. When used properly, the $HOSTNAME$

 *  	  This directive is used to define a longer name or description used

 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *      <td>address</td>
 *      <td>
 *  	  This directive is used to define the address of the host. Normally,
 *  	  this is an IP address, although it could really be anything you
 *  	  want (so long as it can be used to check the status of the host).
 *  	  You can use a FQDN to identify the host instead of an IP address,
 *  	  but if DNS services are not available this could cause problems.
 *  	  When used properly, the $HOSTADDRESS$ @link understandingmacrosandhowtheywork macro
 *  	  @endlink will contain this address. Note: If you do not specify an
 *  	  address directive in a host definition, the name of the host will
 *  	  be used as its address. A word of caution about doing this, however
 *  	  - if DNS fails, most of your service checks will fail because the
 *  	  plugins will be unable to resolve the host name.
 *      </td>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *      <td>display_name</td>
 *      <td>
 *  	  This directive is used to define an alternate name that should be

 *  	  this defaults to the value you specify for the host_name directive.
 *      </td>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *      <td>parents</td>
 *      <td>
 *  	  This directive is used to define a comma-delimited list of short
 *  	  names of the "parent" hosts for this particular host. Parent
 *  	  hosts are typically routers, switches, firewalls, etc. that lie
 *  	  between the monitoring host and a remote hosts. A router, switch,
 *  	  etc. which is closest to the remote host is considered to be that
 *  	  host's "parent". Read the "Determining Status and Reachability
 *  	  of Network Hosts" document located @link determiningstatusandreachabilityofnetworkhosts
 *  	  here @endlink for more information. If this host is on the same
 *  	  network segment as the host doing the monitoring (without any
 *  	  intermediate routers, etc.) the host is considered to be on the
 *  	  local network and will not have a parent host. Leave this value
 *  	  blank if the host does not have a parent host (i.e. it is on the
 *  	  same segment as the Centreon Engine host). The order in which you
 *  	  specify parent hosts has no effect on how things are monitored.

 * 	  that the host belongs to. Multiple
 *  	  hostgroups should be separated by commas. This directive may be

 *  	  This directive is used to specify the short name of the @ref

 *  	  is up or down. Typically, this command would try and ping the host
 *  	  to see if it is "alive". The command must return a status of OK
 *  	  (0) or Centreon Engine will assume the host is down. If you leave
 *  	  this argument blank, the host will not be actively checked. Thus,
 *  	  Centreon Engine will likely always assume the host is up (it may
 *  	  show up as being in a "PENDING" state in the web interface). This
 *  	  is useful if you are monitoring printers or other devices that are
 *  	  frequently turned off. The maximum amount of time that the

 *  	  other than an OK state. Setting this value to 1 will cause Centreon
 *  	  Engine to generate an alert without retrying the host check.
 *
