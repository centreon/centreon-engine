Bug fixes
*********

Notifications between two fixed contiguous downtimes
====================================================

It was possible to have notifications sent between the two downtimes even if
the space duration is 0.

Centreon connectors timeout
===========================

The timeout applied on checks execute by connectors were shorter than the
timeout passed as parameter (near of 1s of difference). To fix this, timeouts
are checked as milliseconds values now (more accurate) and the good duration is
considered by connectors.
