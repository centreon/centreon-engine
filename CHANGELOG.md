# Changelog

## 20.10.3

### Bugfixes

*Host/service status*

They could be sent twice. This new version fixes that.

*Notification macros*

The url encode action is removed from macros $HOSTACTIONURL*$, $HOSTNOTESURL*$,
$SERVICEACTIONURL*$, $SERVICENOTESURL*$, $HOSTGROUPNOTESURL*$,
$HOSTGROUPACTIONURL*$, $SERVICEGROUPNOTESURL*$, $SERVICEGROUPACTIONURL*$.

*Notification Period*

The timeperiods work on contacts and notifications are not sent anymore if the
time period is empty. The notification recovery are now sent when entering in
timeperiod notification.

*Connectors*

When a Perl connector or an SSH connector is used, engine could crash when we
stop it.

When a connector is destroyed, a deadlock could appear while waiting its
destruction.

*Connector restart*

If a connector stops working because of a crash or whatever else, it was not
restarted automatically. It is fixed now.

*Check commands*

When many commands are running, engine could crash when we stop it.

## 20.10.1

`December 16, 2020`

### Bugfixes

*Stalking option*

The stalking option works again, it has been fixed. Make sure you are not
enabling volatile option at the same time to really get an output
stalking.

*Macros filters*

Macros can be filtered. This was possible before and there was a
regression breaking this functionality. So now, we can activate the
macros filtering and then we can specify which macros to send to broker.

*Notifications*

Host/service status field 'Last Notification' was filled when
state was HARD even if no notification is configured nor sent.
