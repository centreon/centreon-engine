The macros in which notification information can be found have been fixed
(ie $NOTIFICATION*$, $HOSTNOTIFICATION*$, $SERVICENOTIFICATION*$)

## 20.04.8

### Bugfixes

*Stalking option*

The stalking option works again, it has been fixed. Make sure you are not
enabling volatile option at the same time to really get an output
stalking.

regression breaking this functionality. So now, we can activate the
macros filtering and then we can specify which macros to send to broker.

state was HARD even if no notification is configured nor sent.

## 20.04.7

`September 3, 2020`

### Bugfixes

*PROBLEMID macros*

It was buggy on hosts and on services (ie HOSTPROBLEMID, LASTHOSTPROBLEMID,
SERVICEPROBLEMID and LASTSERVICEPROBLEMID). This new version fixes this point.

## 20.04.5

`August 18, 2020`

### Bugfixes

*Unicode check was buggy*

The code that validates the UTF-8 strings was buggy and could keep as is some
characters that were not UTF-8. It is fixed and moved to the cbmod module.

## 20.04.4

`July 6, 2020`

### Bugfixes

*On-demand macros on services do not work*

On-demand on service did not work, and most of the time crashed.
This is fixed with this new version.

## 20.04.3

`June 23, 2020`

### Bugfixes

*Windows checks can be CP1252 encoded*

To write into the database such strings is impossible unless we convert the
string to utf-8. This is what is done in this new Engine version. Each time
a check is done, we verify its output is in UTF-8 format, if it is not the
case, it is converted. Supported input encodings are ISO-8859-15, CP-1252 and
UTF-8.

## 20.04.2

`June 16, 2020`

### Bugfixes

*If a host is disabled, it should also be the case for its services*

If a host with several services is disabled, its services are removed from
the monitoring. But a query in centreon_storage shows that those services
are still there. With this new version, it is fixed.

## 20.04.1

`May 12, 2020`

### Bugfixes

*debug_lvl=-1*

Engine was stuck when we put -1 as debug_lvl in centengine.cfg.

## 20.04.0

`April 22, 2020`

### Bugfixes

*Perfdata truncated when read from retention*

Values containing a ';' character were truncated when read from the retention
file. This new release fixes this issue.

*Notifications between two fixed contiguous downtimes*

It was possible to have notifications sent between the two downtimes even if
the space duration is 0.

*Macros replacements*

Host macros and several global macros containing numbers were badly replaced.

### Enhancements

*Support for POLLERNAME macro*

You can now use $POLLERNAME$ macro to retrieve the name of your poller in
a check_command. It will use the poller_name field of your config.

*Support for POLLERID macro*

You can now use $POLLERID$ macro to retrieve the name of your poller in
a check_command. It will use the poller_id field of your config.
