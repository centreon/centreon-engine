SAMPLE OBJECT CONFIG FILE README
================================

This directory contains sample object definition config files. Sample config
files have a .cfg extension. Ignore any files with a .in extension, as they are
templates used to generate the sample config files.

Please note that you can keep all of your object definitions in a single file if
you wish. You may also split them up into multiple config files, as is done
here.

Read the 'Quickstart Installation Guide' in the HTML documentation for
instructions on how to install and use these sample config files.
